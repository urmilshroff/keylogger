# Simple Keylogger

A simple keylogger for Windows written in Python using [Pynput](https://github.com/moses-palmer/pynput). May not work correctly on macOS/Linux.

Requirements: `pip install pynput`

You can rename `keylogger.py` to `keylogger.pyw` to run the keylogger in Ghost Mode, or keep the `.py` extension to keep the command window open. If you use `.pyw`, you must force stop "python.exe" from Task Manager once you're done.
